# kapt-cli
This fork is not really intended to be a cli, but for personal study of how kotlinc works
both for normal compilation and for running kapt.  

This is working for a project with mixed kotlin and java files!

This can also be built with buck with [this branch](https://github.com/thalescm/buck/tree/thalescm-kapt)

## Usage
`./clean && ./kapt`  
or  
`$PATH_TO_BUCK_BIN_ON_THE_BRANCH_ABOVE build sample`
